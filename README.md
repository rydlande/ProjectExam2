# Requirements
```
The requirements section describes whether this project requires anything outside of Drupal core to work (modules, libraries, etc). List all requirements here, including those that follow indirectly from another module, etc. The idea is to inform the users about what is required, so that everything they need can be procured and included in advance of attempting to install the module. If there are no requirements, write "No special requirements".
```

"This module requires the following modules:

- [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
- [Panels](https://www.drupal.org/project/panels)"


"This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core."

# Installation
````
The installation section describes how to install the module. However, if the steps to install the module follow the standard instructions for Drupal 9, Drupal 7, Drupal 6/5, or a theme, don't reinvent the wheel — simply provide a link and explain in detail any steps that may diverge from these steps. Take special note of Drush integrations. In a case where many Drush commands are added, consider adding a section for Drush.

npm install
````


# Configuration
````
The configuration section describes how to configure the module – including, but not limited to, permissions. This section is particularly important if the module requires additional configuration outside of the Drupal UI.

If the module has little or no configuration, you should use this space to explain how enabling/disabling the module will affect the site.
````
"The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, the module will prevent the links from appearing. To get the links
back, disable the module and clear caches."
